Tip 2: Avoid Nested Loops (7 sec)
“Second, avoid too many nested loops. They make your code hard to read. Try breaking them into functions for better readability.”

Tip 3: Use Arrow Functions (7 sec)
“Lastly, use arrow functions for concise and clean syntax. Like this:
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;  

So much cleaner!”

Method 1: .split() (7 sec):

Super useful for text editing!”
